## Course Assignments
* Setting up Visual Studio 2019 with C# solution that includes GIT and Docker
* Creating your first component with unit testing
* Creating a more advanced command line utility library and testing 
* Creating a Calculator with C#: Data Types, Classes, Objects, Interfaces Statics, Data Structures, Built in Libraries, and Flow Control
* Using the package manager to load a library to work with CSV files
* Working with Data using Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
* Create a database and load records using C# and SQL

* REST and JSON
* Deploying your Application to Azure Cloud
## Course Project
Build an interactive command line tool that can load multiple CSV files into a database and perform basic maintenance functions such as resetting the database, resetting the database and loading previously loaded data to restore it.  In addition, the application must also provide a web server REST API that returns JSON for probability and statistical calculation using the data imported into the database from the file.  The application must also generate a log file and the log file must also be available to view through the web page using a separate URL.
### Basic Calculator Operations
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Division
* Multiplication
* Square Root
* Square
### Statistical Calculations
* Mean
* Median
* Mode
* Standard Deviation
* Z-Score
### Project Requirements
The course project must include exception handling, unit testing, integration testing, at least two dll components, and run in a Windows and Docker container on Linux.
